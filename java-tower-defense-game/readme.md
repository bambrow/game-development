# Tower Defense Game

In this game, the player controls a grey ball with the mouse, to avoid and shoot red balls. The grey ball is in the middle of the screen and cannot be moved. The player can use mouse to control the shooting direction of the grey ball. Using the left mouse button or the space key on keyboard, the player can control the grey ball to shoot. The game is over as soon as the player collides a red ball.

 ```bash
