# Dodge Game

In this game, the player controls a grey ball with the mouse, to avoid red balls and collect blue squares. The amount of red balls increases as the player collects more blue squares. Each blue square gets 5 points. The game is over as soon as the player collides a red ball.

To compile and play, simply run the following commands:
```bash
> cd src
> javac -cp ".:../lib/stdlib.jar" *.java
> java -cp ".:../lib/stdlib.jar" Demo
```
